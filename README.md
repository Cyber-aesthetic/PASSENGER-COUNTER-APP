# PASSENGER COUNTER APP
 A PASSENGER COUNTER DESIGNED USING HTML5, CSS AND VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

This code defines 3 functions in JavaScript: "increment", "save", and "reset".

The"increment" function increases the value of the "count" variable by 1 and updates the text content of an HTML element with the id "count-el" to the new value of "count".

The "save" function concatenates the current value of "count" to the text content of an HTML element with the id "save-el" with an underscore "_" added to the end. Then it sets the text content of the "count-el" element to 0 and sets the "count" variable back to 0.

The "reset" function sets the text content of the "save-el" element to "Previous entries:".

You can use this code as a starting point, but you may need to make additional adjustments to it depending on your specific use case.
